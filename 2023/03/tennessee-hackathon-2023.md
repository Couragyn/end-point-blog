We just had our first company gathering in our Tennessee office after a hiatus of several years. About 20 End Pointers came to our Johnson City, Tennessee office to work on various VisionPort projects. For several of us, it also provided an opportunity to meet each other in person for the first time. 

### End Point Tennessee office (EPTN)

Other than our Johnson City-based team, for many of us this was our first look at our Tennessee office from where the VisionPort systems are assembled, tested and shipped.

Our Content Management System (CMS) team worked on some exciting updates to our VisionPort CMS, including some important modifications to our touchscreen systems, and improved the user interface in other ways. Meanwhile our Research & Development team worked on upgrades to the VisionPort system itself, focusing on integrating large and small touchscreens for multimedia presentations. One such improvement was support for 8 table-top touchscreens integrated to serve 16 museum visitors simultaneously.

Our support team worked on testing and spinning up documentation to bring our inventory up to date and prepare for the next wave of our new VisionPort CMS installations.

### Casablanca

The luxurious lounge working space at one of our AirBnB locations, nicknamed Casablanca, enabled us to be comfortably spread out as we worked together on various projects.

A morning meeting with plenty of room left:

A quiet comfy corner for planning!

### Pigeon

Just across from Casablanca, we did some relaxing in the "Pigeon coop", another luxurious abode:

### Birthdays, dinner, and farewell 

We also had a couple of employee birthdays to celebrate during the hackathon!

And a tasty dinner with everyone the final evening:

It was great to see everyone at the Tennessee office. We did plenty of hard work, sometimes sitting elbow to elbow. It certainly was a great opportunity after working together remotely, and helped us experience the camaraderie which is typical of End Point's unique spirit. Until next time, we will continue to improve our VisionPort systems and extend our remote collaboration!
